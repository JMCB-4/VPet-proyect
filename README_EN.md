## Introduction
The project I present aims to create an interactive **VPET** (Virtual Pet), developed using JavaScript and the Kaplay API. This project will be carried out gradually while I continue with my studies, which will allow me to learn and improve my programming skills as I progress in the development.

The core idea of the VPET proyect is to offer a dynamic experience where users can interact with a virtual pet, feed it, take care of it and watch it evolve based on the decisions they make.

The choice of JavaScript and the Kaplay API as key tools for the development of this project was the result of the search for an alternative similar to the technologies used in class, but with the aim of exploring new options and avoiding the use of the same tools. In addition, I intend to practice the use of Git and GitHub to manage the code and collaborate more efficiently in the development of the project.

This project is not only a technical challenge, but also an opportunity to apply my programming skills in a practical project that combines elements of design, interaction and web development. Through this experience, I hope to strengthen my skills and obtain a functional product that I can continue to improve over time.


## Development journal
This development journal aims to document the progress and challenges faced in the creation of my VPET project using JavaScript and the Kaplay API. Throughout this log, it will reflect key decisions, technical issues and implemented solutions, as well as my learnings and reflections on the tools and the development process. It will be a useful tool to monitor the progress of the project and evaluate my skills as I progress in its construction.

### Creation of the idea
03-12-2024

The main idea of the project is to create a virtual pet (VPet or Virtual Pet) that has several needs that the user must satisfy, such as feeding it when it is hungry. To do this, I made a list of features and functionalities that I want to implement, which can be expanded or adjusted depending on the technical feasibility of the project. I will leave the list in a section below and will update it as I continue with the project.

### Tool search and first practice
04-12-2024 ~ 05-12-2024

The IDE I have selected for the project is **Visual Studio Code**, due to its ease of use, extensive customization and the large amount of documentation and tutorials available, which will allow me to quickly resolve any bugs or problems that arise during development.

For the implementation of the project, I researched various libraries and tools that could facilitate the process. After an exhaustive search, I decided to use **Kaplay**, an open source API that uses HTML5 and JavaScript for the creation of web games. This API stands out for its ease of integration and for the excellent documentation available on its [website](https://kaplayjs.com/), which includes practical examples and the possibility of testing the code directly on the site.

In order to familiarize myself with the new environment, I read the documentation and made the introductory example that they have as 'my first project', in which I developed a game inspired by the style of [Chrome Dino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinosaur_Game).

### Interface development
06-12-2024 

I create the project and develop an initial interface, which has a predefined resolution, a solid color background, a sprite for the VPET and two buttons that, for the moment, do not perform any action.

### Animations
11-12-2024 

To make my project looks more fun, I have added an Idle animation (the base animation of VPET). In addition, I have implemented an effect on the buttons: when you hover the mouse over them, they increase in size, which creates a sense of interaction and selection.

### Hunger system
16-12-2024 

I have created a hunger system for the virtual pet. The pet gains hunger according to the time it spends, and to feed it, it is necessary to press button A. Button B displays on the console the VPET's hunger level, with a value from 0 to 3, where 0 means that it is completely hungry. To make it more visually understandable, I have created a hunger bar that fills up as the pet eats. The idea is that, in the future, button B will also show the full VPET status.
